# madison-courses
This project views all the courses offered at a given time at University of Wisconsin - Madison.

By running webscraper.py, the user can update the database by webscraping the official guide.wisc.edu/courses/ webpage. To make the information easy to view, I created a webapp using the MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) tech stack. While this project may not have been the most complicated, it was completed with professional practices and modeled with an MVC (model-view-controller) architechural pattern.
